# Build a REST API with Golang and MongoDB

`configs` is for modularizing project configuration files

`controllers` is for modularizing application logics.

`models` is for modularizing data and database logics.

`responses` is for modularizing files describing the response we want our API to give. This will become clearer later on.

`routes` is for modularizing URL pattern and handler information.
